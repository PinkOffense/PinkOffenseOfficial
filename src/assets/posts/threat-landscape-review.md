# Threat Landscape Review: Key Trends for Security Teams — January 2026

A monthly analysis of significant security events, emerging attack vectors, and actionable intelligence for defensive teams.

## Key Trends This Month

### 1. Supply Chain Attacks Continue to Evolve

We observed an increase in attacks targeting build pipelines and dependency management systems. Organizations should audit their CI/CD configurations and implement dependency pinning with integrity verification.

### 2. Identity-Based Attacks Dominate Initial Access

Credential stuffing, MFA fatigue attacks, and social engineering of help desks remain the primary initial access vectors. The shift from perimeter-based to identity-based attacks continues to accelerate.

### 3. AI-Assisted Phishing

Phishing campaigns are becoming more targeted and linguistically sophisticated. Traditional email filters based on language patterns are less effective. Behavioral analysis and domain reputation checks are increasingly important.

## Defensive Recommendations

- **Review MFA configurations** — Ensure phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2, certificate-based) is deployed for privileged accounts
- **Audit service accounts** — Map all service account usage and rotate credentials
- **Dependency management** — Implement automated scanning and pinning in build pipelines
- **Incident response drills** — Tabletop exercises should include supply chain compromise scenarios
